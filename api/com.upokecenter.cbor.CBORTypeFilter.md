    public final class CBORTypeFilter extends Object

Specifies what kinds of CBOR objects a tag can be. This class is used when a
 CBOR object is being read from a data stream. This class can't be
 inherited; this is a change in version 2.0 from previous versions,
 where the class was inadvertently left inheritable.
